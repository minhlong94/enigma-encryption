# Enigma encryption
A simple (well not quite) Enigma machine encryption, showing step-by-step simulator.
The model used is Wehrmacht Machine I, five rotors I-V and three reflectors A, B and C.
The code does not use any external library.

Instruction: complile it using Python. Any input must use integer or CAPITALIZED string.
Since I do not make any syntax error input, please input it as instructed:
1. Program asks input for the RIGHT rotor. Input an integer as instructed.
2. Program asks input for the MIDDLE rotor. Input an integer as instructed.
3. Program asks input for the LEFT rotor. Input an integer as instructed.
4. Program asks input for the REFLECTOR. Input an integer as instructed.
5. Program asks for the positions of the rotors. Input an integer as instructed.
6. Program asks for the plugboards. Input it in the type of CAPITALIZED string. Example: "AT GX RK". If you do not want any, simply press Enter.
7. Program asks for the text you want to encrypt. Input it in the type of CAPITALIZED string.
8. Output

WARNING: The code to check accuracy is provided by the NSA: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/enigma-simulator. Please DO NOT use cryptii.com since they encrypt it WRONG when two rotors turn at the same time.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions.
